    <p>We’ve recently updated your pilot certificate to clarify the operating rules and safe distances required for you to operate your drone safely.  Please note that your privileges to fly a drone have not changed and remain the same.</p>

<ul>
	<li>You may fly up to 400 ft (122m) or <strong>in accordance with a Special Flight Operating Certificate-<abbr title="Remotely Piloted Aircraft System">RPAS</abbr></strong></li>
<li>You may not fly in controlled airspace, or within 5.6km (3 nautical miles) or an airport, or 1.9km (1 nautical mile) of a heliport, whichever distance is greater</li>
</ul>

<p>For <a href="#">Advanced operations:</a></p>
<ul>
	<li>You may fly up to 400 ft (122m), or <strong>in accordance with a Special Flight Operating Certificate-<abbr title="Remotely Piloted Aircraft System">RPAS</abbr> or as authorized by the provider of air traffic services in controlled airspace</strong></li>
<li>Operations are permitted in controlled airspace <strong>if authorized by the provider of air traffic services</strong></li>
<li>You may not fly within 5.6km (3 nautical miles) of an airport, or 1.9km (1 nautical mile) of a heliport <strong>unless the operation is conducted in accordance with an established procedure for that airport or heliport</strong></li>
